#+Title:FSA21 - SRTS - SW Exercise

** Description
The objective is to implement a program for sorting a list of integers in
ascending order in a reliable way by employing either of the SW redundancy
principle of /N-Version Programming/ with 3 diverse versions and majority
voting.

** Environment Setup
This application has been developed, tested and compiled in Ubuntu-20.04 and
GNAT Ada compiler version 9. For testing, the project uses GNATtest, which is
contained in the =asis-programs= package and must be installed separately. The
whole environment can be installed with:

#+begin_src bash
$ apt install gnat gnat-gps asis-programs
#+end_src

The package =gnat-gps= is highly recommended for developers.

** Installation
Simply use the 'gprbuild' command to compile the program. No installation
instructions required. Run it from the =bin= directory:

#+begin_src bash
$ gprbuild
$ ./bin/n_sort_voting
#+end_src
